## The data

To demonstrate the usefulness of EDM in estimating the impact of causal variables, we use a real-world dataset that reflects
daily temperature and crime levels in Chicago, which we make available in the [chicago.csv](chicago.csv) file.

First, we load the time series into R:

```{r load-data}
chicagoURL <- url("https://github.com/EDM-Developers/fastEDM-r/raw/main/vignettes/chicago.csv")
chicago <- read.csv(chicagoURL)
head(chicago)
```

Plotting the two time series shows:

```{r plot-time-series-lines}
library(ggplot2)

df <- data.frame(list(
  t = rep(chicago$Time, 2),
  variable = c(rep("Crime", nrow(chicago)), rep("Temperature", nrow(chicago))),
  value = c(chicago$Crime, chicago$Temperature)
))

ggplot(df, aes(x = t)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = value, color = variable)) +
  labs(colour = "Time series")
```

When plotted as a scatter plot, there appears to be some linear correlation between the variables:

```{r plot-time-series-scatterplot}
ggplot(chicago, aes(x = Temperature, y = Crime)) +
  geom_point(color = "#F8766D")
```

Calculating the linear correlation between `Crime` and `Temperature`:

```{r linear-correlation}
cor(chicago["Temperature"], chicago["Crime"])
```

shows a mild correlation, however the causal structure (if any) and its direction is not shown.

<!-- As the two time series are on different scales, we can normalize them before running an EDM analysis. -->

<!-- ```{r rescale} -->
<!-- chicago[["Crime"]] <- scale(chicago[["Crime"]]) -->
<!-- chicago[["Temperature"]] <- scale(chicago[["Temperature"]]) -->
<!-- head(chicago) -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Find the optimal embedding dimension

Now we use `edm` to find the optimal embedding dimension of the `Temperature` time series.
We check the values of $E = 2, \dots 10$.
<!-- The `crossfold=5` option means that, for each $E$ value we run 5 sets of predictions, and for each set we take four fifths of the data for training and predict the remaining one fifth. -->


```{r find-optimal-embedding-dimension}
library(fastEDM)

# Suppress the progress bar in vignettes, as it confuses knitr.
formals(edm)$showProgressBar <- FALSE

res <- edm(chicago["Time"], chicago["Temperature"], E = 2:10, numThreads = 4)
```

From the `rho` column we can see that the prediction accuracy is maximised when $E = 7$, so we take this as our estimate of the embedding dimension.

## Convergent cross-mapping

The `edm` command can also run the cross-mapping task, which allows us to ascertain the causal links between the crime and temperature time series.

```{r convergent-cross-mapping}
# Find the maximum library size for the dataset.
res <- edm(chicago["Time"], chicago["Temperature"],
  E = 7,
  full = TRUE, saveManifolds = TRUE, verbosity = 0
)
libraryMax <- nrow(res$Ms[[1]])

# Choose a linearly spaced grid of library sizes to evaluate the S-map algorithm on.
libs <- ceiling(seq(10, libraryMax, length.out = 25))

# Run the convergent cross-mapping in each causal direction.
crimePredictsTemp <- edm(chicago["Time"], chicago["Crime"], chicago["Temperature"],
  numReps = 2,
  algorithm = "smap", E = 7, library = libs, k = 100, numThreads = 4, verbosity = 0
)

tempPredictsCrime <- edm(chicago["Time"], chicago["Temperature"], chicago["Crime"],
  numReps = 2,
  algorithm = "smap", E = 7, library = libs, k = 100, numThreads = 4, verbosity = 0
)
```

Plotting the results gives:

```{r plot-ccm-rho-L}
tidyDF <- data.frame(list(
  Library = c(
    crimePredictsTemp$summary$library,
    tempPredictsCrime$summary$library
  ),
  Direction = c(
    rep("Temperature | M(Crime)", nrow(crimePredictsTemp$summary)),
    rep("Crime | M(Temperature)", nrow(tempPredictsCrime$summary))
  ),
  Correlation = c(
    crimePredictsTemp$summary$rho,
    tempPredictsCrime$summary$rho
  )
))

ggplot(tidyDF, aes(x = Library, y = Correlation)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = Direction)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("steelblue", "darkred")) +
  geom_point(data = tempPredictsCrime$stats, aes(x = library, y = rho), alpha = 0.05, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_point(data = crimePredictsTemp$stats, aes(x = library, y = rho), alpha = 0.05, color = "darkred")
```

<!-- Convergent cross-mapping plot of accuracy against library size](chicago-rho-L.svg) -->

In this plot, we can see that one direction shows a significant increase in accuracy as $L$ increases, whereas the other direction is pretty flat.
The direction which increases the most is the $\texttt{Temperature} \mid M(\texttt{Crime})$ direction.
This notation means we used  $\texttt{Crime}$ to predict $\texttt{Temperature}$, and due to the backward nature of EDM means it refers to the causal link $\texttt{Temperature} \to M(\texttt{Crime})$.
Therefore, we'd conclude that there is a causal link from temperature to crime, though no link in the reverse direction (which would be implausible).

## Inspecting the S-map coefficients 

If we run `edm` with the `saveSMAPCoeffs=TRUE` option, we can store the fitted S-map coefficients into variable which start with the prefix `beta`.

```{r save-smap-coefficients}
# Library size should be 4365
tempPredictsCrime <- edm(chicago["Time"], chicago["Temperature"], chicago["Crime"],
  algorithm = "smap", E = 7, k = Inf, saveSMAPCoeffs = TRUE,
  numThreads = 4
)

crimePredictsTemp <- edm(chicago["Time"], chicago["Crime"], chicago["Temperature"],
  algorithm = "smap", E = 7, k = Inf, saveSMAPCoeffs = TRUE,
  numThreads = 4
)

# . edm xmap temp crime, e(7) alg(smap) k(-1) savesmap(beta)
# Percent complete: 0...10...20...30...40...50...60...70...80...90...
# Percent complete: 0...10...20...30...40...50...60...70...80...90...

#     temp ~ temp|M(crime)            4365          .54886          14.661
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Note: Number of neighbours (k) is set to 4364
# Note: The embedding dimension E is 7
```

Plotting them allows us to see the contemporaneous effect of temperature on crime.
